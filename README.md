- **Dynamic DOM Updates:** Uses JavaScript to manipulate HTML elements in real-time without reloading the page.
- **Data Validation:** Includes a robust validation helper to handle missing or undefined data points safely.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Information displays are toggled using the `hidden` attribute based on the app state.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **HTML5**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **API:** FreeCodeCamp Weather Proxy (OpenWeatherMap compatible)
